# Responsive-Portfolio

This website is a responsive portfolio that can be viewed on various platforms, contains information about myself, a portfolio of my work on GitHub, and a Contact Us page that is not yet operable. 

Notes:
1. I did not include my phone number, as I am not comfortable putting it out there for anyone to see. 
2. I provided the link to my GitHub email address, as I am not comfortable listing my email address for just anyone to see.
