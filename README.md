# Responsive-Portfolio

This website is a responsive portfolio that can be viewed on various platforms, contains information about myself, a portfolio of my work on GitHub, and a Contact Us page that is not yet operable. It also includes links to my GitHub Profile, with pinned projects, my LinkedIn profile, GitHub email, Phone # filler, and a PDF version of my resume.

Notes:
1. I did not include my phone number on my Profile or GitHub Profile, as I am not comfortable putting it out there for anyone to see. 
2. In my Profile I provided the link to my GitHub email address, as I am not comfortable listing my email address for anyone to see. This applies to my GitHub profile, as well.
